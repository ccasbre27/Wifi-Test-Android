        Having problems with your Skype for Business calls?
        An Internet connection is the most likely culprit. A poor
        Internet connection can cause low-quality audio and
        video, delays, and dropped calls.\n\n
        If you have a slow connection, the following tips
        might help:\n\n
        Move closer to the WiFi access point or move around
        to get a better signal.\n\n
        Switch to another hotspot if available.\n\n
        Disable WiFi on your device and try enabling it again.\n\n
        If your modem, or router is old, then everything will
        seem to be running slow even with a fast connection. It
        might be worth upgrading your hardware if all else fails.
